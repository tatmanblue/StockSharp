					You can create multiple instances of the same source. For example, 
					several Finam instances that will save the downloaded data to different 
					folders. This can be done, as with the initial addition, from 
					the <legacyBold>General</legacyBold> tab, select <legacyBold>Add => Sources</legacyBold>. Unnecessary sources can 
					be deleted using the button <mediaLinkInline><image xlink:href="hydra_delete"/></mediaLinkInline>.

					<para>The next step is to configure the source. The source 
					is configured in the right panel. Detailed setup is described in <link xlink:href="f005431b-3a1b-49c2-a389-f1d4e9756f45" />.</para>

					  <para>To enable the source to download data after clicking 
					  the <legacyBold>Start</legacyBold> button, it must be enabled. 
					  To do this, select the source icon in the left panel and use 
					  the button <mediaLinkInline><image xlink:href="hydra_source_on_off"/></mediaLinkInline> 
					  to switch it on or off. You can perform this operation before 
					  or after adding instruments for downloading, as described below.</para>

					<para>
						In the central part, the panels of the added sources 
						will open, where the list of instruments is displayed. If the 
						panel is closed, then to open it, double click the source logo 
						in the list on the left side of the program. The data will be 
						downloaded only by the added instruments.
					</para>
					<para>Then you need to add instruments. To do this, click 
					the <legacyBold>Add</legacyBold> <mediaLinkInline><image xlink:href="hydra_add"/></mediaLinkInline>.

      <para>Initially, the instrument database in <token>hydra</token> is empty, 
      there is only an auxiliary instrument <legacyBold>ALL@ALL</legacyBold>. When this instrument is selected, 
      data will be downloaded for all available instruments for this source. Therefore, 
      if you need to download data for some specific instruments, you need to find 
      them (search for the instrument database, as well as for the available instruments 
      that a specific source provides) and add to the source.</para>
	  
	  <para>To download the instruments, you have to click the corresponding <legacyBold>Download Instrument</legacyBold> button.</para>
	  
      <para>After the instruments are received, the window will become the following.</para>
      <mediaLink>
        <image placement="center" xlink:href="hydra_security_full_list" />
      </mediaLink>
      <para>In which all the instruments available for adding will be visible.</para>
      <para>The selected instruments will be displayed in the <legacyBold>Instruments</legacyBold> table, 
      which is a table with a tree structure. The main element of this is the instrument, 
      and the additional ones are the market data types that will be obtained for this instrument.</para>
				</content>
			</step>
						<step>
				<content>
				      <para>
			For each instrument, you need to select the market data types you need to download.
	  </para>
	  <para>
			If all the necessary instrument parameters are not set, the 
			<mediaLinkInline><image xlink:href="hydra_zero" /></mediaLinkInline> icon will appear in the left column of the instrument line..

<para>At the bottom of the source window is a panel with buttons for setting up the data and instruments to be received.</para>
      <mediaLink>
        <image placement="center" xlink:href="hydra_Quick_start_02" />
      </mediaLink>
      <para>The following operations can be performed from this panel:</para>
					<list class="bullet">

  						<listItem>
  							<para>Set up the amount of information received with 
  							the buttons: <legacyBold>Trades, Order Books, Candles, Order Log, Level 1, Own Transactions</legacyBold>. 
  							Lists of available market data types vary for different sources.</para>
  						</listItem>
  						<listItem>
  							<para>Specify the necessary periods for the downloaded candles. The periods of the received candles vary for different sources.</para>  
  						</listItem>
  						<listItem>
  							<para>Specify what the market data will be built from. If you do not specify 
  							this option, candles available in the source will be received, otherwise the candles 
  							will be built from another type of market data. For example, candles can be built from 
  							the price of the last trade, the order book spread (usually for the Forex market), 
  							volatility or the best price.
  							</para>
  						</listItem>
  						<listItem>
 <para>Specify the periods of the data to be received. You can specify your period for 
 obtaining data for each data type. For example, for daylight candles, you can specify 
 the download for the last few years, and for trades, specify the download for the last 
 few months. Periods of the received data can be set not only from the panel, but also 
 directly in the table of market data.</para>
 </listItem>
  						<listItem>
  							<para>Edit using the <mediaLinkInline><image xlink:href="hydra_edit"/></mediaLinkInline> button, you

  						<listItem>
       		<para>When you click the <legacyBold>All@All</legacyBold> button , all instruments added 
       		to the source will be deleted, and instead of them one auxiliary instrument All@All will 
       		be added, which will download the market data for all available instruments for the source.</para>  						</listItem>

					<alert class="note">
  						<para>Pay attention. To get information on order books, 
  						an order log, level 1, own transactions, you need to connect to the connector in real time.</para>

						When all the settings are applied, and the instruments 
						are selected, on the <legacyBold>General</legacyBold> tab, you can click the <legacyBold>Start</legacyBold> button. 
						This will launch the active sources, and they will start downloading 
						the data. The work process can be observed in the 
						special <legacyBold>Logs</legacyBold> tab, which is fixed at the bottom of the program. 
						In addition, logs are stored in files in the local directory.
